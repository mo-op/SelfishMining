# SelfishMining
A Python project to implement a simulation of selfish mining in Bitcoin.

Based on the following papers:
<br/> [Majority is not enough](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ie53/publications/btcProcFC.pdf)
<br/> [On profitability of selfish mining](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~ricardo.perez-marco/publications/articles/OnSelfishMining20.pdf)

This project is a work in progress and is trying to look for more intelligent ways to run the simulation. Please get in touch with the author to collaborate/ offer suggestions.
